# type() fun is used to find the datatype of given variable in python
a= 3
t = type(a)#  class<int>
print(t)
# class<float>
h = 7.8
k = type(h)
print(k)

#class<str>
i= "anu"
l= type(i)
print(l) 

#using the type function we can convert the one form of dattype to another like 
q= "67.4"
v=float(q)# it is strng but the we want it as float
m=type(v)
print(m)
